I have imported Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries
I have taken the webpage of TimeOfIndia
I did pull the page content with Requests, parsed it and fetched just the headline with BeautifulSoup
I have added all the headlines into a .txt file with file handling concept
I have provided both the code and file in this repository
